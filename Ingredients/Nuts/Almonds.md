*Almonds* are a nut packed with protein, vitamins, minerals, healthy fats and phytochemicals. These work to assist in a healthy digestive system, feeling of satiation, reduced inflammation levels, and increased muscle health. They are versatile, being made into a [[Almond Milk|'milk']], ground up into [[Almond Meal|almond meal]].

When combined with savoury ingredients, they make for a fine sauce that pairs well with #RecipeBook/Cuisine/Asian cuisine. Whole almonds, when blended into a butter, pair well with [[Apple|apples]] or as a spread on toast.
The nutty flavour also works well in #RecipeBook/TypeOfFood/Smoothie, making it just that bit more creamy while imparting a nutritional boost and a very mild nutty flavour.

Finally, they're also great to eat when not combined with anything.
