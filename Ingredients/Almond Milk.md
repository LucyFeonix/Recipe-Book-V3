*Almond milk* is a liquid made from [[Almonds|almonds]]. This is done through soaking whole almonds, and blending them into a creamy, rich liquid. It has a unique texture and nutritional content, enabling it to substitute for [[Milk|milk]] in almost any recipe. Contrary to the cow's milk that is conventionally used, almond milk will impart a subtle nutty flavour onto whatever it is combined with. 

As with any other milk, almond milk can also be made into cheese, tasting similar to dairy-based cheese. They make for great #RecipeBook/Diet/Vegan or dairy-free alternatives for their respective dairy-filled counterparts.
