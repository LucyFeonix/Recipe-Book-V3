*Almond meal* is what remains after crushing [[Almonds|almonds]] when making [[Almond Milk|almond milk]]. The fresh, paste-like substance can easily be used within a few days for #RecipeBook/TypeOfFood/Smoothie, mixed into [[Yogurt|yogurt]] or oatmeal, or it can be dried out for later use.

Dry almond meal is flour-like, though slightly denser. This makes any #RecipeBook/Course/Baking dish slightly denser and chewier when used. Essentially, though, it can be used the same as any other flour, despite being gluten-free.
