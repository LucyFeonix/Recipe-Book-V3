The *ancho chilli pepper*is a mild-hot chilli pepper, primarily used in the #RecipeBook/Cuisine/American/Mexican kitchen, rating at about 2'000 to 5'000 on the Scoville scale. It has a smoky flavour, with a bitterness similar to baker's chocolate. 
It excels in #RecipeBook/TypeOfFood/Enchiladas and #RecipeBook/TypeOfFood/Salsa - or rather, these types of food excel when these peppers are used, as it is usually what is 'authentically' used. These are a ripened version of the green [[Poblano Pepper|poblano pepper]], compensating the mild spiciness with a sweet taste. 
They can be substituted for/by [[Pasilla Pepper|pasilla peppers]].
