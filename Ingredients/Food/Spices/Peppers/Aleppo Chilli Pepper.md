The *Aleppo chilli pepper* is a moderately spicy pepper, primarily used in Turkish, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. It rates about 10'000 Scoville, with a fruity flavour, and a mild, [[Cumin|cumin]]-like undertone. 

Generally, it is used in the form of crushed flakes, which are typically slightly milder and oilier than conventional crushed red pepper. It is dried, so it contains no inner flesh or seeds, contributing to the mild flavour. It can be substituted for/by [[Crushed Red Pepper  Flakes|crushed red pepper flakes]] or [[Paprika|paprika]].
