Cilantro is a herb popular in many cuisines. In English, it is referred to as both cilantro and coriander. Usually, when it is named cilantro, the leaves are intended, and for coriander the seeds of the plant are the goal. While a solid rule of thumb, this is not universal. The leaves are used more often in most asian cuisines, while the seeds are more common in European cuisines.
It is a pungent and intense herb, but can be described as fresh and lemon-like, and pairs very well with [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]], [[Potato|potatoes]], [[Pumpkin|pumpkin]], [[Mint|mint]], [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Lime|lime]] and much more. In general, the more something absorbs flavour or the more intense a flavour already is, the better cilantro can pair with it.
> [!warning] To a part of the population, cilantro tastes like soap, due to some genetic tomfoolery. Be sure to ask if the person you're cooking for is okay with the flavour.
## Leaves
Cilantro leaves are usually added right before serving to make sure it retains most of its flavour and its bright green colours. They can be found most often in #RecipeBook/TypeOfFood/Salsa, #RecipeBook/TypeOfFood/Chutney or simply as garnish.
Raw leaves are the most powerful in aroma and are often added to salsa, chutney, #RecipeBook/TypeOfFood/Pesto, #RecipeBook/TypeOfFood/Marinade, and #RecipeBook/TypeOfFood/Dressing. They can also be added to #RecipeBook/TypeOfFood/Salad for a flavour boost.
Additionally, it is great in cooked meals, as it deepens any flavour already present. Do take care to not add too much, as it can easily be overpowering. The later it is added, the more powerful it is.
## Seeds
Coriander seeds and roots are often used during the cooking process to infuse the dish with their unique flavour. This is most often practiced in #RecipeBook/TypeOfFood/Curry, #RecipeBook/TypeOfFood/Soup, #RecipeBook/TypeOfFood/Stew , and pickled vegetables. Dried and ground coriander powder is a longer-lasting alternative to the fresh leaves, and especially shines in curries and soups.
