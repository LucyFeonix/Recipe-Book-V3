Turbinado sugar is a [[Brown Sugar|brown sugar]] made from crystallised, partially evaporated sugar cane juice, which has been spun in a centrifuge to remove almost all of the molasses. Because of this refining process, the sugar crystals are large and golden-coloured. 
They carry a subtle, caramel-ish flavour.
