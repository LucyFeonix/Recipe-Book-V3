*Anise*, or *aniseed*, is a plant native to the Mediterranean region, as well as southwest Asia. It is widely used to flavour food, candy, and alcoholic drinks. When used as a spice, it is similar to [[Star Anise|star anise]], [[Fennel|fennel]], [[Liquorice|liquorice]], and [[Tarragon|tarragon]]. In Western markets, it is mostly displaced by star anise, as it is much easier to cultivate.

The spice is sweet and aromatic, with a very characteristic flavour. The seeds are used in the preparation of teas, as well as in the preparation of many local candies and confections. It is occasionally used as a digestif, used in brines, or as a flavouring agent in certain meat products.
When freshly chopped, the leaves are sometimes added to cheese spreads, dips, #RecipeBook/TypeOfFood/Salad, and the roots are sometimes used as a milder variant of liquorice in a soup or stew.

Outside of culinary uses, it is used in many alcoholic drinks, such as [[Ouzo|ouzo]], [[Mastika|mastika]], [[Sambuca|sambuca]], [[Absinthe|absinthe]], and [[Rakija|rakija]]. It is also a common root used in [[Root Beer|root beer]].
