*Anchovies* are small fish, oftentimes brined and canned for consumption. They are prized by chefs and cooks around the world for their briny flavour and versatility, being used on #RecipeBook/TypeOfFood/Pizza, #RecipeBook/TypeOfFood/Sandwich, #RecipeBook/TypeOfFood/Salad, or simply eaten whole. 
They have a distinctive, salt and umami flavour, which they bring to any dish or ingredient that they are used in. In essence, they can be used in the same way as a spice or a herb would, either subtly bringing flavour to a dish or being a dominant flavour when used improperly.
