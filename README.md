# Recipe Book V3
This is a collection of recipes by LucyFeonix for the purpose of having an archive of what I (want to) cook.
All rights belong to the original authors of the recipes where relevant, as tagged in the recipes.

This collection of recipes is made to work in Obsidian, a free note-taking app, obtainable at https://obsidian.md/. The plugins and look are fully up to you, but I recommend Recipe View for the purposes of cooking. 

Please feel free to add a pull request for any recipes of your own that you'd like to add, or correct me on anything if you see it relevant.

Enjoy :)
