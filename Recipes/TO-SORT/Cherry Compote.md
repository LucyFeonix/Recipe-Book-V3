# Ingredients

- Time: 
# Directions
1. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the cherries, mandarin juice, sugar, and a pinch of [[Salt|salt]]. Stir to combine, and bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring occasionally and adjusting the heat as needed to maintain the simmer, until the cherries are softened but still hold their shape – 15-20 minutes more. Spoon a little bit more than half the cherries into a medium bowl. Continue to simmer the remaining cherries and fruit juices until the mixture reduces by about half and becomes a syrupy, glossy sauce, about 10 additional minutes.
2. Pour the sauce over the cherries in the bowl, stir to combine, and cool completely. The compote will thicken as it cools. Use the cooled compote right away or transfer it to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 7 days.
