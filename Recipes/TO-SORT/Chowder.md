# Directions
1. Trim off the tough, dark green top from the leek. Quarter the leek lengthwise, then thinly slice crosswise into ⅛-inch pieces. Place the leek in a medium bowl, fill the bowl with cold water, and use your hands to separate the pieces and coax out any remaining dirt. Drain through a fine-mesh strainer and repeat this process until there is no dirt left. Dry the leek pieces well.
2. Place the clams in a large bowl, and fill with enough cold water to cover the topi of the clams by ±1 inch. Sprinkle 1 tbsp of the flour over the water and use your hands to stir it into the water and around the clams. Set aside for 15 minutes. The clams will eat the flour and spit it out, which will also help remove any dirt. Drain the water and do this once more with another tablespoon of flour. Rinse the clams well under cold running water.
3. In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, bring the water to a low boil. Add the clams, and cover with a tight-fitting lid, and cook until the clams open, 5-7 minutes; hold the lid firmly and give the pot a good shake several times during the cooking process. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the clams to a large bowl. Strain the cooking liquid through a fine-mesh sieve into another large bowl. Reserve the clams and the clam broth.
4. In the same Dutch oven (no need to clean it) set over medium heat, add the butter and cook until just melted. Add the celery, carrots, leek, and fennel. Season with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Black Pepper|pepper]], and cook, stirring occasionally, until all the vegetables are softened except the carrots (they will still be crisp-tender at this point), about 15 minutes. Add the wine and cook, stirring frequently, until it is almost gone, 5-7 minutes. Ad the remaining ⅓ cup flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes. Stir in half the reserved clam broth until smooth, then add the remaining clam broth and stir again until there are no visible clumps of flour. Add the potatoes and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are tender and the soup has thickened to the consistency of gravy, 22-25 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, remove the clams from their shells and roughly chop them; discard the shells. Reduce the heat in the Dutch oven to medium and stir in the milk and cream, then sprinkle in the peas and cook until the milk mixture is hot and steamy and the peas are bright green and tender, 5-7 minutes. Stir in the chopped clams and the tarragon, and cook until the clams are hot, 2-3 minutes more. Taste the chowder and season with salt and pepper. Ladle the soup into bowls and top with a sprinkle of hand-torn pieces of the fennel fronds if using. Serve immediately.
