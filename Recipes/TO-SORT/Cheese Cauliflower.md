# Directions
1. Place 2 racks in the upper and bottom position in the oven, and place a baking sheet on each. Preheat the oven to 450°F
2. In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt half the butter until bubbly. Add the breadcrumbs, a large pinch of [[Salt|salt]], and several grinds of [[Black Pepper|pepper]].  Toast the breadcrumbs, stirring frequently, until golden brown and crispy, 6-8 minutes. Pour the crumbs into a small bowl.
3. Rinse out the saucepan (no need to wipe dry) and fill it halfway with water. Add 2 cups of the cauliflower and a large pinch of salt, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and cook for 7-9 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid, and simmer until the cauliflower is very soft, about 15 minutes. Drain well. Add the cauliflower to a blender along with the milk, and blend until very smooth.
4. In the same saucepan, melt the remaining butter over medium heat. Add the flour and garlic and cook, whisking constantly, until the garlic is softened and the flour is lightly toasted, ±2 minutes. Pour in the blended cauliflower and the thyme.
5. Increase the heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer, about 5 minutes, whisking frequently. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, whisking frequently, until the sauce is thickened to the consistency of very creamy gravy, 5-7 minutes.
6. Turn off the heat under the saucepan and add the havarti and gruyère, a handful at a time, whisking well after each addition. Continue whisking until the cheese has melted and the sauce is smooth. Season with salt and black pepper and cover with a lid to keep warm.
7. In a large bowl, toss the remaining cauliflower with the oil until well coated. Season liberally with salt and pepper, and toss once more. Divide the cauliflower between the 2 now-hot baking sheets, and roast until just tender and deeply browned in spots, about 15 minutes, giving the baking sheets a good shake and rotating them top to bottom after 10 minutes.
8. Spread a couple large spoonfuls of the warm cheese sauce on the bottom of a large serving platter. Scatter the roasted cauliflower on the platter, then top with the remaining sauce. Stir the parmesan into the panko and sprinkle over the cauliflower.
9. Serve immediately.
