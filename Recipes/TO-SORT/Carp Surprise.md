# Directions
1. Position 2 racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat the oven to 425°F.
2. Fold four 12x16” pieces of parchment paper in half crosswise and trim the corners of each to cut out a large heart shape. The shape doesn’t have to be perfect, and it’s better to err on the side of too large than too little. Unfold the sheets and arrange the hearts on the baking sheets.
3. Trim the tough green top from the leek, then quarter the leek lengthwise. Cut each piece into ⅛-inch slices. Place into a medium bowl, fill the bowl with cold water, and use your hands to separate the pieces and coax out any remaining dirt. Drain in a fine-mesh strainer. Spread the leek out on a towel and dry well.
4. In a large bowl, combine the leek, fennel, chard, peas, and garlic. Drizzle with 2 tbsp of olive oil, then season with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Black Pepper|pepper]]. Use your hands to rub the oil and seasoning into the vegetables; the vegetables should wilt slightly. Mix in the chervil.
5. Evenly divide the vegetables among the parchment hearts, keeping the vegetables on the right side of the shape. Brush the fish fillets all over with the remaining 2 tsp olive oil and season with salt and pepper./ Place a fillet on top of each pile of vegetables. Evenly drizzle the wine over the fish and vegetables, and sprinkle with the capers. Place 2 pats of butter on each fish, and top each with a lemon slice.
6. Fold the top half of the heart over the fish and vegetables, then use your fingers to make small overlapping folds along the edges of the parchment to seal the packets. As you fold the parchment, make sure to press and pinch together the paper edges to ensure that steam will not escape during the cooking. Place the sheet with the packets in the oven and bake until the parchment paper puffs up slightly and is lightly browned in spots, about 15 minutes.
7. Transfer the packets to 4 large dinner plates. Being very careful to avoid the hot steam arising, unfold the edges of the parchment hearts or use kitchen shears to cut the packets open through the top. Serve immediately.
