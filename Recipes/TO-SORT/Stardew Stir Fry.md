# Directions
1. In a small bowl, whisk together the stock, soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, sugar, and white pepper. Add the cornstarch and whisk again until the cornstarch is completely dissolved.
2. Heat a large wok or very large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the cooking oil and swirl to coat the bottom. When the oil starts to shimmer and lightly smoke, add the mushrooms and stir-fry until lightly browned around the edges and starting to soften, 2-3 minutes. Scatter the carrots and onions over the mushrooms and stir-fry until just starting to become crisp-tender, 3-4 minutes. Add the ginger and garlic and stir-fry until slightly softened and aromatic, ±30 seconds. Add the snow peas and kale, then add a large splash of water and stir-fry until the snow peas are crisp-tender and the kale turns bright green and starts to wilt and soften, ±2 minutes.
3. Give the sauce a good stir, then pour it over the vegetables, ±1 minute. Remove from heat and serve immediately, garnished with the toasted sesame seeds. Serve along rice.
