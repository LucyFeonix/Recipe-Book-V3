> [!note] When using asparagus, take care to trim the woody end, and cut the asparagus into 1-to-1½-inch pieces. Reduce the cooking time in the boiling water to 30 seconds, and the sautéing time to ±2.5 minutes. 
# Directions
1.  Fill a large saucepan with water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, remove any papery covering from the fiddlehead ferns and wash the fiddleheads well under cold running water. Fill a medium bowl with ice water, season the water aggressively with [[Salt|salt]], and set aside. Line a large plate with paper towels.
2. Once the water is at a boil, season it aggressively with salt, then add the fiddleheads. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the fiddleheads turn bright green and are crisp-tender, 5-7 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the fiddleheads to the ice bath. Stir several times until the fiddleheads are no longer hot, then transfer to the paper-towel-lined plate and set aside.
3. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the stock to a low boil, then cover and reduce the heat to low.
4. In a large high-sided skillet over medium heat, warm 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Add the shallot, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 6-8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until softened, about 2 minutes.
5. Increase the heat slightly, stir in the ice, and cook, stirring frequently, until the rice is lightly toasted and smells nutty; 3-5 minutes. Pour in the wine and simmer, stirring occasionally, until most of the wine has been absorbed, ± 2 minutes.
6. Add 1 cup of the hot stock and cook, stirring constantly, until the stock is absorbed by the rice ± 3.5 minutes. Repeat with a second cup of stock. Continue adding stock, now only ½ cup at a time, stirring and cooking until the rice is just tender, ±25 minutes. Adjust the heat as needed during the cooking process to maintain an active simmer. It is possible that you do not use all of the stock, save any remaining stock to loosen the risotto later, if needed.
7. Reduce the heat to low, add the pecorino and 2 tbsp of the butter,  and stir vigorously until the rice is creamy, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat, season to taste with salt and [[Black Pepper|pepper]], and cover with a lid to keep warm.
8. In a large cast-iron skillet set on medium heat, warm the remaining tablespoon olive oil. Add the remaining tablespoon butter and swirl the skillet until melted. Add  the fiddleheads and season liberally with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and hot throughout, 3-4 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the parsley and lemon zest.
9. To serve, spoon the hot risotto into 4-6 large serving bowls, and top it with the sautéed fiddleheads. Drizzle with more olive oil, sprinkle with additional pecorino cheese, and garnish with the chervil. Serve immediately.
