# Directions
1. Carefully separate the egg whites and egg yolks into two bowls: a large one for the whites and a medium one for the yolks.
2. Use an electric hand mixer on medium-high speed to whip the egg whites until they triple in size and form medium-stiff peaks, about 2 minutes.
3. Drizzle the milk over the egg yolks, then use the mixer to whip the yolks until the mixture is slightly airy and pale yellow, about 2 minutes. Gently fold the yolks into the whites until just combined.
4. Heat a medium cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat. Add the butter to the warm skillet and swirl to coat the bottom and up teh sides. Carefully pour the egg mixture into the skillet and cook until the bottom of the eggs has set, 6-8 minutes. Cover the skillet with a lid and cook until the top has mostly set (eggs should be set around the edges but still slightly wet and foamy on top), 4-6 minutes. Season the eggs with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Black Pepper|pepper]], and sprinkle with the cheese. Cover the skillet again and cook until the cheese is melted, ± 2 minutes.
5. Sprinkle the eggs with the herbs. Use a rubber spatula to loosen the sides of the omelet, then fold the omelet over. Switch to a wide metal spatula to carefully transfer the omelet to a plate. Serve immediately, along with some spoonfuls of the parsnips.
