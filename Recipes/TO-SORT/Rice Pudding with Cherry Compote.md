# Directions
1. Put the rice into a fine-mesh strainer and quickly rinse with cold water. You’re just trying to wash away any dirt or debris left on the rice, not rinse away the starch. Set the rice aside to dry slightly, ±15 minutes.
2. Place the 4 cups of milk in a medium bowl. Slice the half-pod of vanilla in half lengthwise and use the back of a paring knife or butter knife to scrape out the seeds. Place the seeds and the scraped pod into the milk. Give it a good stir to combine, then set aside.
3. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the rice and cook, stirring frequently, until the rice is opaque and bright white and the butter has become very foamy, 5-7 minutes. Add the vanilla milk (including the pod), the water, sugar, and a good pinch of [[Salt|salt]]. Bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring and scraping the saucepan occasionally, 20-25 minutes. (don’t rush this process, don’t want to scorch the milk). Continue to cook, adjusting the heat as needed to maintain a simmer, until the rice is very plump and tender and the milk has thickened and coats the grains of rice, 25-35 additional minutes, stirring frequently.
4. Remove the saucepan from heat and scoop the rice pudding into a medium bowl. Let cool at room temperature for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. The pudding will thicken significantly as it cools. Cover and transfer to a refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 5 days. Once chilled, the rice pudding will be thick; if you prefer a thinner consistency, stir in additional milk until the pudding is perfect for you.
5. Remove the vanilla bean from the pudding and scoop the pudding into 4-6 small serving bowls. Top with spoonfuls of the cherry compote, then sprinkle with the toasted sliced almonds. Serve.
