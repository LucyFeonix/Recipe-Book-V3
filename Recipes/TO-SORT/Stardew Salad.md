# Directions
1. Trim the tough green top from the leek. Slice the leek in half lengthwise, then cut the halves in half again. Cut the leeks into ⅛-inch slices. Transfer the leek to a medium bowl, fill the bowl with cold water, and use your hands to separate the pieces and coax out an dirt. Drain through a fine-mesh strainer until there is no dirt left remaining.  Spread the leek on a towel to dry.
2. In a medium skillet over medium-low heat, warm ¼ cup of the olive oil, then add the leek and the garlic and thyme. Season with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Black Pepper|pepper]], and cook, stirring occasionally, until the leek is very tender but not browned, 15-20 minutes. Remove the thyme, then transfer the mixture to a medium bowl and let cool completely.
3. Meanwhile,., slice the top and bottom off of the grapefruit so it can sit flat on a cutting board. Slice along the curve of the fruit, from top to bottom to remove the peel and ptih. Working over a medium bowl to catch any juices, use a small paring knife to cut between the membranes to release the grapefruit segments. Place the segments in a small bowl. Squeeze any remaining juice from the fruit into the medium bowl.
4. Into the bowl with the leek and olive oil, pour ¼ cup of the grapefruit juice. Add the vinegar, mustard, honey and a pinch of salt and pepper. Slowly whisk the remaining 3 tbsp of oil to make a vinaigrette.
5. In a large bowl, combine the dandelion greens, endive, carrots, and parsley. Drizzle with half the vinaigrette, season to taste with salt and pepper, and toss gently to combine. Transfer half the salad to a large serving platter and nestle half the grapefruit segments in the greens. Scatter the remaining salad on top., add the remaining grapefruit sections, and drizzle with additional vinaigrette. Serve immediately.
