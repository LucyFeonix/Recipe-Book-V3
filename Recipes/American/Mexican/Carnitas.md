# Directions
1. Rinse and dry the pork shoulder, rub all over with salt and pepper.
2. Combine the oregano, cumin, and olive oil.
3. Place the pork in a slow cooker, top with the onion, jalapeño, minced garlic, and the orange juice. Slow cook on low for 10 hours or on high for 7 hours. *Alternatively, add two cups of water around the pork, cover tightly with foil, and roast for 2 hours on 160C in the oven. Then, roast for another 1-1.5 hours while uncovered. Add more water if the liquid dries out too much.*
4. Pork should be tender enough to shred. Do so using two forks.
5. *The following steps are optional if the previous ones were done in the oven.* Heat some oil in a large nonstick pan over high heat. Spread the pork in the pan, drizzle over some of the juices. Wait until the juices evaporate, and the bottom side is golden brown and crusty. Turn and briefly sear the other side.
6. Remove the pork from the skillet. Repeat in batches - don't crowd the pan.
7. Just before serving, drizzle over more juices and serve hot, stuffed in tacos.
