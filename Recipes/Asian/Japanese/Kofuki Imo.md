# Directions
1. Cut the peeled potatoes into 1 ½ inch pieces. Add the pieces to a medium pot and fill with water until it is an inch above the potatoes. Bring the water to a boil, and cook the potatoes until they are tender, ±8 minutes. 
2. In a large skillet or pan, combine the soy sauce and sugar over medium high heat. Once bubbling and the sugar is dissolved, add the cooked potato pieces and gently stir until well coated. Continue to cook until no liquid remains.
3. Remove from heat and toss with the butter. Serve immediately.
