# Directions
1. In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, sake, mirin, ginger juice, and the sugar. Mix well, until the sugar is dissolved.
2. Trim the extra fat off of the ribeye steak, and put them in a resealable plastic bag. Add 4 tbsp of the teriyaki sauce (from step 1) to use as marinade.  Tightly seal the bag, and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Let return to room temperature before cooking.
3. Meanwhile, heat the teriyaki sauce.
4. Before cooking the meat, make sure the steaks in the marinade are at room temperature. In a cast-iron skillet or frying pan, heat the oil on medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, remove the steaks from the marinade, and pat them dry with a paper towel to prevent steaming.
5. For medium-rare steak, add the steaks to the pan and sear for 2 minutes on one side, and then 1 ½ minutes on the other.
6. Pour 2 tbsp of the teriyaki sauce over each steak. The sauce gets bubbly and gives the steak a glaze.
7. Let the steaks rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing.
8. *Garnish with sliced scallion or white sesame seeds*
