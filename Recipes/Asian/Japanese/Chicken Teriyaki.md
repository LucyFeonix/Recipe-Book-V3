# Directions
1. In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine the soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar. Microwave until hot, and mix well to dissolve the sugar.
2. Place the thighs smooth side down on a cutting board. Score the chicken so that the thighs cook evenly. Cut slits across the meat every ½ inch without slicing all the way through. Make deeper slits on the thicker parts, and skip scoring the thin parts. After each cut, press open and flatten the meat.
3. Lightly season the chicken pieces with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Black Pepper|pepper]]
4. Heat a large frying pan over medium to medium-high heat. Add the oil. When the oil is hot, place the chicken smooth side down in the pan.
5. Cook the chicken for 5 minutes. Immediately, press down hard on the chicken with a spatula for 5-10 seconds to give the presentation side a nice sear. 
6. Flip over the chicken. Immediately press down again for 5-10 seconds.
7. Switch to low heat, then cover with a lid, and steam the chicken for 3 minutes.
8. Open the lid. Use a paper towel to wipe the excess grease and protein from the pan. This helps create a more transparent sauce.
9. Increase the stove’s heat to medium and add the teriyaki sauce to the pan. Tilt the pan, and frequently spoon the sauce over the chicken. When the chicken is well-coated with the sauce and cooked through, transfer out of the pan.
10. Continue cooking the sauce until it’s thick to your liking. Then, transfer to a bowl. Remember to stop cooking while the sauce is slightly thin because the residual heat will continue to thicken the sauce.
11. Slice the chicken into bite-sized pieces, and serve on a plate with the sauce drizzled on top.
