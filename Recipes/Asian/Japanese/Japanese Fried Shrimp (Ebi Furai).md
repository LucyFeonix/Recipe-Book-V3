# Directions
1. Put water in a sauce pan, and gently add 2 of the eggs. Bring the water to a boil on medium heat. Once the water boils, lower heat but keep the water boiling for the next 12 minutes. Discard the water and run under cold water. When the eggs are almost cool, they are ready to peel.
2. Meanwhile, dice ¼ onion finely and soak in cold water for 10 minutes.
3. Finely chop the pickle.
4. Drain the onion after 10 minutes. Put on a paper towel, and squeeze the water out.
5. In a bowl, break the eggs into small pieces. Add the pickles, the onion, [[Salt|salt]] and [[Black Pepper|pepper]], and squeeze some juice from the half lemon. Then, add the kewpie mayonnaise *and chopped parsley*.
6. Season the prawns with salt and pepper. Dredge them with the flour, and then the remaining eggs. Repeat once. Then, coat in the bread crumbs, and shake off the excess.
7. Deep-fry the prawns in oil for about 2½ minutes per batch, with about 2-3 prawns per batch. Transfer onto a wire rack to remove the excess oil.
