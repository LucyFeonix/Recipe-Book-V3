# Directions
1. Cut the tofu into cubes, about 2 ½ cm wide.
2. Sift the flour, corn starch and baking powder into  a large plate. Add half of the salt and pepper seasoning, then mix well.
3. Use a clean kitchen towel or kitchen paper to pat dry the tofu cubes, then put them into the flour mixture. Evenly and thinly coat all sides. Remove the excess flour, if possible.
4. Heat up oil in a wok/pan over medium-high heat. Gently put in the tofu (working in batches if necessary). You should see bubbles appearing around the tofu straight away, otherwise the oil is not hot enough yet.
5. Use chopsticks or tongs to flip the tofu several times to ensure each side is evenly fried. Transfer out to a plate lined with kitchen paper when all sides are nicely golden.
6. Add the shallots, chilli pepper, and garlic to the pan, and fry over medium heat for about a minute.
7. Add the fried tofu cubes, chopped scallions, and and the remaining salt and pepper seasoning. Toss briefly to season evenly, and serve immediately.
