# Directions
1. Gently rinse the dried lily flower buds and shiitake mushrooms with tap water, and transfer them into bowls. Add 1/2 cup hot water to each bowl to cover. Let soak until tender (~30 min). Once done, squeeze the marinating liquid back into the bowls, and gently rinse them with tap water again to remove any dust on the surface.
2. Slice the shiitake mushrooms. Cut the lily flowers in half. Chop the wood ear mushrooms into small pieces.
3. Heat 1 tbsp [[Oil|oil]] in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sichuan pepercorns. Cook, stirring occasionally, until strongly fragrant and the peppercorns darken. Scoop them out, and discard.
4. Add the rehydrated lily flowers, shiitake mushrooms, and wood ear mushrooms. Cook, stirring frequently, for ~1 minute. 
5. Add the white part of the scallions. Cook and stir for ~30 seconds.
6. Move everything to one side of the pan, and add the remaining 1/2 tbsp oil to the other side. Add the minced meat on top of the oil, then use a spatula to spread it out. Let the pork cook for a minute without moving to brown the bottom, then cut it into small pieces.
7. When the pork is cooked through, pour in the shaoxing wine and scrape the pan to release any brown bits.
8. Pour in the soy sauces and stir to coat well.
9. Add the water and the reserved soaking water. Add the chicken stock cube. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, and cook for 2 minutes.
10. Mix in the corn starch slurry and stir to mix well, and let cook until the sauce thickens. Adjust the seasoning by adding a pinch of salt, if needed.
11. To serve, scoop the tofu pudding using a large spoon into two serving bowls. If too much liquid is pooling in the bowl, tilt the bowl carefully to drain off the excess liquid. Ladle the gravy on top of the tofu pudding. Serve immediately.
