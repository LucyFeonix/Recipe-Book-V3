# Directions
1. Pat the duck dry with kitchen paper, then rub salt over the skin and the cavity. Put the duck over a wire rack with a tray underneath to collect any drips, and leave to rest on the counter for 1 hour.
2. Bring about 1½ litres of water to a boil, then gently pour it over the entire duck skin – remember to flip it over and do the other side. If there are feather ends on the skin, remove them with a tweezer.
3. In a bowl, mix the maltose with hot water and vinegar until completely dissolved. Brush a layer of the mixture over the duck skin. Leave to rest in the fridge for 1 hour, then brush on another layer. Keep refrigerated (uncovered, but on the rack and tray) for 24 to 48 hours.
4. One hour before roasting, take the duck out of the fridge to bring it back to room temperature. Put all the stuffing ingredients – scallions, garlic, apples, star anise, cassia cinnamon and bay leaves – into the cavity. Use toothpicks or skewers to seal the openings of the cavity.
5. Preheat an oven at 200°C (convection) or 220°C (conventional). Put the duck over the middle rack of the oven with the breast side facing up. Place a roasting tray at the bottom of the oven to collect any dripping fat during roasting. Leave to cook for 15 minutes.
6. Then lower the temperature to 180°C. Use aluminium foil to cover the tip of the wings and the end of the legs. Continue cooking for another ±60 minutes.
7. Check the doneness by inserting an instant-read thermometer into the inner thigh area near the breast. This should read at least 74°C / 165°F.  
8. Take the duck out of the oven and leave it to rest on the counter for 15 minutes.
9. While waiting, prepare the sauce. Add ½ tbsp of duck fat to a pan, and add the sweet bean sauce and sugar. Mix and simmer over low heat until tiny bubbles appear. Transfer to a small serving dish, and whisk to fully incorporate the sauce and fat.
10. Slice the duck into pieces, and serve hot.
