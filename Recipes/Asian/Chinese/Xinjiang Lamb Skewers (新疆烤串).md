# Directions
1. Combine the oil, soy sauce, corn starch, cumin powder, chilli powder, and salt in a small bowl. Mix well. This is the marinade.
2. Trim fat from the lamb meat if necessary. Cut the lean part into 1.5cm cubes. Cut the fat into thin pieces half the size of the lean pieces.
3. Thread the lamb cubes closely onto the skewers, alternating between lean meat and fat.
4. Spread the onion inside a 1-gallon ziploc bag. Place the lamb skewers on top of the onion. Pour the marinade over the lamb. Massage the bag so the lamb is covered evenly with the marinade. Seal both sides of the bag, and place upside down, the onions facing up. Let marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature, or overnight in the fridge.
5. Transfer the lamb skewers onto the grilling grate, one finger’s width apart. Flip frequently until the lamb turns dark brown on all surfaces. Generously sprinkle a layer of cumin powder, then chilli powder. Flip, and repeat. *Sprinkle whole cumin seeds onto the lamb for extra flavour,* and grill until the meat is cooked through.
