# Directions
1. In a large bowl, combine the corn starch, salt, and black pepper. Add the chicken pieces to the bowl, and toss them to coat evenly with the mixture.
2. Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Fry the coated chicken pieces in batches for 4-5 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the oil, and set it aside on a paper towel-lined plate.
3. In a small saucepan, combine the soy sauce, honey, rice vinegar, ketchup, minced garlic, minced ginger, and sesame oil. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the  heat to low and simmer for 5-6 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.
