# Directions
1. Cut the pork into long strips or chunks about 2-3” thick. Don’t trim any excess fat.
2. Combine the sugar, salt, five spice powder, white pepper, sesame oil, wine, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, molasses, and garlic in a bowl to make the marinade.
3. Reserve about 2 tbsp of marinade, and set it aside. Rub the pork with the rest of the marinade in a large bowl or baking dish. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or at least 8 hours. Cover and store the reserved marinade in the fridge as well.
4. Preheat your oven to ‘bake’ at 475°F with a rack positioned in the upper third of the oven.
5. Line a sheet pan with foil and place a metal rack on top. Place the pork on the rack, leaving as much space as possible beween the pieces. Pour 1 ½ cups of water into the pan below the rack. This prevents any drippings from burning or smoking.
6. Transfer the pork to the pre-heated oven. Roast for 25 minutes, keeping the oven setting at 475°F for the first 10 minutes of roasting, then reduce the temperature to 375°F. After 25 minutes, flip the pork. If the bottom of the pan is dry, add more water. Roast another 15 minutes.
7. Combine the reserved marinade with honey and 1 tbsp of hot water. This will be the basting sauce.
8. After 40 minutes of roasting time, baste the pork, flip it, and baste the other side. Roast for a final 10 minutes.
9. Remove from the oven, and baste with the last bit of reserved BBQ sauce. Let the meat rest for 10 minutes before slicing.
