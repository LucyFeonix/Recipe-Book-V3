- Time: 1 hour 30 minutes
# Directions
1. Soak the dried ingredients in warm water until they enlarge and become softer. This will take at least one hour.
2. Slice the mushrooms into thin strips, and tear the lily buds lengthwise into thinner strands.
3. Cut the pork, against the grain, into thin strips. Mix with a ½ tsp corn starch and 1 tsp water, then coat with oil, and set aside.
4. Slice the carrots, bamboo shoots and tofu into thin strips, and lightly beat the egg.
5. In a wok or large pot, bring the stock to a full boil. Add the marinated pork, quickly stirring with chopsticks to separate the strands. Use a (slotted) spoon to skim off the froth appearing on the surface.
6. Add the shiitake and wood ear mushrooms, the lily buds, the carrot, and the bamboo shoots. Cook for ± 2 minutes.
7. Turn down the heat and keep the soup at a gentle simmer. **Slowly** mix the corn starch slurry into the soup, stirring with a spoon/ladle.
8. Once the soup becomes thick, slide in the tofu, and slowly pour in the egg in a circular motion.
9. When the soup starts bubbling again, turn off the heat, and add the black rice vinegar, soy sauce, white pepper and sesame oil.
