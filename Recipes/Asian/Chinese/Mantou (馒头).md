# Ingredients
- 250g [[Flour|flour]]
- 1 tsp [[Yeast|yeast]]
- ¾ tsp [[Baking Powder|baking powder]]
- 1 tbsp [[Granulated Sugar|granulated sugar]]
- 130mL lukewarm water
# Notes
- 6 servings
- Requirements:
- Time: 52 minutes
# Directions
1. Mix flour, yeast, baking powder and sugar. Add the water gradually. Mix with chopsticks / spatula until no more loose flour can be seen. Combine, and briefly knead into a dough. Cover and leave to rest for 10 minutes. Knead again until very smooth.
2. Divide the dough into 6 pieces. Knead and fold the dough piece towards the centre of the ball, resulting in a smooth outer surface. Rotate the ball between your hands to form a slightly raised shape.
3. Line a steamer basket with parchment paper or brush with a thin layer of oil, and place the buns inside. Leave ample space between each bun, and let rest for about 30 minutes.
4. Place the steaming basket onto a pot filled with cold water. Start cooking with high heat. Turn down to medium-low once the water is at a full boil. Steam for 10 minutes from this moment.
