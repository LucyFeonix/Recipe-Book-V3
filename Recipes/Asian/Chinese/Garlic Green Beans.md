# Directions
1. Snap off the tough ends of the green beans. If they're very long, halve them.
2. Heat the oil in a wok over medium-high heat. To check to see if the oil is hot enough, stick bamboo chopsticks into the wok so that the tip of the chopsticks are touching the bottom. You want to see tiny bubbles rapidly forming around the chopsticks. Alternatively, throw a green bean into the wok. If bubbles start to form immediately, the oil is ready.
3. Working in batches, fry the green beans for about 2 minutes, until the green beans start to wrinkle on the outside. You don't need to cook the green beans for too long. Use a spider strainer to strain the oil from the beans, and then transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels. Repeat util all the beans are fried.
4. Carefully pour the hot frying oil into a bowl. Use the residual oil to fry the garlic.
5. Heat the wok over medium-high heat. Add the minced garlic, and cook it for about 30 seconds. Add the green beans back to the wok, along with the salt, and stir to combine.
6. Turn off the heat, and garnish with red pepper flakes. Serve hot.
