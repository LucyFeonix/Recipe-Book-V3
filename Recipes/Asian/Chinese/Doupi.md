# Directions
1. Soak the glutinous rice in water for at least 2 hours. Drain and set aside.
2. In a pan, heat the sesame oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and ginger and sauté until fragrant.
3. Add the sliced pork and cook until it is no logner pink. Then, add the shiitake mushrooms and bamboo shoots, and continue to cook until the vegetables are tender.
4. Add the dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, oyster sauce, and shaoxing wine to the pan. Stir well to combine all the ingredients. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Mix the mung beans, seasoning and rice milk in a blender to make the pancake batter.
6. Spread a layer of batter in the hot, oiled wok to make a large circular pancake. Break the eggs over the batter as the batter starts to solidify. 
7. Flip the pancake.
8. Add a layer of glutinous rice in the form of a square. Cover the rice with a layer of the meat mixture. Fold the sides of the pancake over the filling to form a rectangular package.
9. Fry until the batter turns golden brown and crispy, and then flip the pancake and fry the other side until the batter turns golden brown and crispy.
10. Cut into squares, and serve hot, garnished with chopped scallions.
