# Directions
1. Heat a wok with the oil over medium-high heat, until hot. Spread the potato pieces in the pan, without overlapping. Cook without moving until the bottom turns golden. Flip to cook the other side, until golden. Transfer the potatoes to a big plate.
2. Your pan should still have plenty of oil. Place the eggplant in the pan and spread the pieces without overlapping. Cook the eggplant without moving it until the bottom turns golden brown. If the oil in the pan is fully absorbed by the eggplant before cooking through, add a bit more oil to the pan. Turn to medium heat if the pan starts to smoke. Flip the pieces to cook the other side until golden brown. Transfer to the plate with the potatoes.
3. Add the garlic and scallions toa the pan, and stir a few times until fragrant.
4. Add the peppers, and mix well.
5. Mix the water, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, shaoxing wine, sugar, salt and a third of the corn starch in a bowl. Make sure the corn starch is fully dissolved, and then pour into the pan.
6. Return the eggplant and potato to the pan. Cook and stir until the sauce has thickened and evenly coated the vegetables.
7. Serve hot with steamed [[Rice|rice]].
