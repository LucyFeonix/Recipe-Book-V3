# Directions
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and keep at a bare simmer.
2. Combine the bread crumbs, 1/3 of the cheese, half of the parsley and chives, 1/4 of the shallots, 1/4 of the garlic, and olive oil in a medium bowl. Massage with hands until combined; season to taste with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Black Pepper|pepper]].
3. Melt butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until foaming. Add the sausage, break up with a wooden spoon and brown well. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the sausage to a small bowl, leaving fat behind.
4. Increase the heat to high, add the mushrooms to the skillet, and cook, stirring frequently, until the moisture has evaporated and the mushrooms are well-browned. Add the remaining garlic and shallots, and cook until fragrant. Add the soy sauce and lemon juice, and stir to combine.
5. Add the flour, and cook, stirring, until a thin film begins to form on the bottom of the pan. Slowly whisk in chicken stock, followed by heavy cream. Bring to a simmer and cook until thickened.
6. Stir in the remaining grated cheese until melted. Then, stir in the remaining parsley and chives, along with the reserved sausage. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
7. Cook the pasta in salted water according to package directions until just shy of al dente. Drain, reserving one cup of cooking liquid.
8. Add the mushroom mixture to the pot of pasta, and stir to combine. Add cooking liquid to adjust the consistency - it should be very loose, but not soupy.
9. Broil in the oven until golden brown.
