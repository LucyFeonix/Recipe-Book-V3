# Directions
1. In a medium skillet, combine 4 tablespoons of oil, garlic, anchovies, and a pinch of [[red pepper|red pepper flakes]]. Cook over medium heat until garlic is very lightly golden  (+- 5 minutes). Add capers and olives, and stir to combine.
2. Add the tomatoes, stir to combine, and bring to a bare simmer. *Stir in the canned tuna, flaking it gently with a fork.* Remove from heat.
3. Cook the spaghetti in lightly [[Salt|salted]] boiling water,  until just shy of al dente - about 2 minutes less than package instructions.
4. Using tongs, transfer the pasta to the sauce. 
5. Add a few tablespoons of pasta water to sauce and set over medium-high heat to bring the pasta and sauce to a vigorous simmer. Cook, stirring and shaking the pan to keep the sauce loose, until the pasta is perfectly al dente.
6. Remove from heat, and add the remaining olive oil, the parsley, and the cheese.  Season with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Black Pepper|pepper]], and serve immediately.
