- 2 cloves [[Garlic|garlic]]
- 1/2 tsp [[Salt|salt]]
- 3 tbsp [[Red Wine Vinegar|red wine vinegar]]

- Requirements: 
- Time: 2 hours and 20 minutes
# Directions
1. Pluck the outer leaves off the heads of puntarelle. Tear or cut into bite-sized pieces, and set aside. Remove the shoots from the heads, and discard the woody bottom end of each. Cut the shoots into 1/4" thick strips. Cut the base in half lengthwise, and then cut the halves into strips.
	1. *If using endives instead: quarter endives lengthwise without removing the cores. Slice each quarter into 1/8"  strips lengthwise, at an angle through the core, so that the leaves remain attached.*
2. Transfer the prepared puntarelle or endive to a bowl, and cover fully with cold water and a handful of ice cubes. Cover to make sure it keeps submerged, and refrigerate until curled, 2-18 hours.
3. Drain, and dry in a salad spinner. 
4. Place anchovies, garlic, and salt on a cutting board, and mash with the back of a fork until a coarse paste forms. Transfer to a medium bowl. Add the vinegar, and whisk until uniform. Add the oil in a thin stream, whisking constantly, until emulsified.
5. Add the puntarelle or endive, the parsley, and half of the capers into a salad bowl, and toss to coat with the dressing. Season with salt and [[Black Pepper|pepper]] to taste.
