1. Brush both sides of the baguette slices with olive oil, and then place the baguette slices on a baking sheet. Lightly toast the bread directly under the broiler until golden brown, half a minute to a minute per side. Remove, and rub the top of each baguette slice with the cut side of the garlic.

4. Remove the topped baguette slices from the oven, then secure each with a toothpick. Sprinkle with sherry vinegar and serve immediately.
