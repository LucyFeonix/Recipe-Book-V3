# Directions
1. Heat milk until lukewarm, and remove from heat. Add yeast and sugar, and stir briefly. Let this sit for 5-10 minutes, you will see the yeast bubbling.
2. In a bowl, combine flour and salt, and stir briefly. Add the egg and mix through the flour. Whilst mixing, pour in the milk mixture. Keep mixing until a smooth batter forms.
3. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for an hour until it has doubled in volume.
4. 15-20 minutes before the batter is ready, put your pan with oil on the stove, and heat it until it reaches 180C.
5. Dip your spoons into the oil to prevent the dough from sticking.Use two spoons (or an ice cream scoop with trigger release) to form a ball of dough. Scoop 4-5 balls into your pan.
6. Bake the balls for 4-6 minutes until golden brown, turning them halfway through if they do not on their own.
7. Dip your spoon into the oil again before each batch. There is no need to clean your spoon after each round.
8. When your oliebollen are ready, put them in a strainer lined with kitchen paper. THe paper absorbs excess fat, which is a good thing.
9. Serve with [[Powdered Sugar|powdered sugar]] and enjoy.
